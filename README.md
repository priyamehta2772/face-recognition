In this project we extracted landmarks of a face using dlib library. Then using those landmarks we performed the following algorithms on it:<br/>
Approach 1 : In the first approach, we use representative landmark as a feature to identify different faces using 1NN algorithm. <br/>
Approach 2 : In the second approach, we use the differences between representative landmark and other landmarks of face to identify different faces using 1NN algorithm. <br/>
Approach 3 : In the third approach, we give the differences between representative landmark and other landmarks of face to identify different faces using SVM algorithm. <br/>
